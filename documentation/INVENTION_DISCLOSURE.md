2. Real-time resource optimization
3. Automated quality gates based on ML insights
4. Unified monitoring of code quality and system health

### B. Objectives
1. Reduce CI/CD pipeline failures by 40% through predictive analytics
2. Achieve 95% accuracy in build success prediction
3. Enable real-time anomaly detection in system metrics
4. Automate deployment decisions using ML thresholds

### C. State of the Art
| Patent ID | Abstract | Research Gap | Novelty |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| US2023000000A1 | CI/CD monitoring | No ML integration | Random Forest build predictor |
| CN1154800A | Build time estimation | Static thresholds | GBM regression with feature engineering |
| EP4130000A1 | Deployment analytics | No real-time UI | Integrated dashboard with D3.js |

### D. Technical Implementation
**Core Components:**
1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Git repository analysis (commit frequency, diff sizes)
   - System metrics monitoring (CPU/RAM/Network)
   - CI/CD pipeline metadata extraction

2. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
```python
class FeatureGenerator:
    def create_temporal_features(self, build_history):
        # Time-series features for last 10 builds
        return rolling_features

    def normalize_metrics(self, system_stats):
        # Z-score normalization
        return standardized_features
```

3. **ML Architecture**
- **Build Success Predictor**: Random Forest Classifier (85 features)
- **Build Time Estimator**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest + DBSCAN clustering

4. **API Layer** (FastAPI):
```python
@app.post("/evaluate-build")
async def evaluate_build(build: BuildData):
    features = preprocessor.transform(build)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return {"approval": prediction > 0.8}
```

5. **Dashboard UI** (React + Material UI):
- Real-time pipeline health visualization
- ML model performance monitoring
- Threshold configuration interface
